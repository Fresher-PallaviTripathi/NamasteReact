* package.json is confirguration for npm it keep tarck on what version of package install into our system (it may be caret ^2.16.3)
* package-lock.json keeps tracks of exact version that is being install
* npm is package manger which manage all package which we install in our system
* buddler (webpack) bundle or package our app properly so it can be shift to production
* their are two types of dependencies 1- Normal dependencies 2 - devdependencies ,the devdependencies 
  use for development phase but dependencies are used in production also.

 * .gitignore contains all the files which i don't want to put on github

* CTRL+F for search any specific things in
* we got emoji by window + . 
* A transitive dependency is when a package you installed (direct dependency) depends on other packages (its own dependencies).
* nodu_modules is kind of database where all  our package ,all our files, all our dependencies actual code is there.
* why we should not required  put node_module on github but we can put package.json and package-lock.json =>if i have package.json and package-lock.json 
  you can recreate  all your nodu_modules even if it deleted 

* just like we have npm similarly we have somethings known as npx ,when we write npm it means we are just calling the command of npm like we 
  install some things but npx means executing a package
