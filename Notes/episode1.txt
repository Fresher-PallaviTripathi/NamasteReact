Answer of them are:
✅ 1. What is Emmet?

Think of Emmet like a text shortcut or autocomplete for HTML/CSS.

🔹 Just like typing "brb" on your phone becomes "be right back", Emmet lets you type ul>li*3 and expands it into:

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


🔹 It's a speed tool — saves time writing repetitive code.




✅ 2. Library vs Framework (Real-life analogy)
📚 Library

A library is like a cookbook. You pick and use the recipe (code) you need.

You’re in control. You decide when to use it.

Example: React, jQuery

🏗️ Framework

A framework is like a meal kit (e.g., HelloFresh) — it gives you ingredients, steps, and structure.

Framework is in control. You follow its rules.

Example: Angular, Django

🔁 In short:

Library = You call it.
Framework = It calls you.




✅ 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
📦 CDN = Content Delivery Network

Imagine your website is a pizza shop 🍕, and you want to deliver pizzas globally.

Without CDN: Only 1 shop → slow delivery 🌍

With CDN: Many branches worldwide → faster delivery 🚀

🔹 CDN hosts your static files (JS, CSS, images) closer to the user for fast loading.

Example:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18/umd/react.production.js"></script>




✅ 4. Why is React called React?

Because React helps the UI react to changes.

📱 Imagine you're using a messaging app. As soon as a new message comes, the chat updates automatically — this is reactive behavior.

🔹 React uses a Virtual DOM to detect changes and update only what's needed, making UI super fast.




✅ 5. What is crossorigin in <script>?

This attribute deals with security and resource sharing when loading scripts from another website (like a CDN).

💡 Think of it like ordering a part from another store. Do you want to send your ID or just get the part anonymously?

anonymous → Don’t send cookies or login info

use-credentials → Send cookies/login info

Example:

<script src="script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>




✅ 6. Difference between React and ReactDOM
🧠 React

Deals with building components and logic

Like your brain creating ideas

👀 ReactDOM

Renders those components into the actual page (DOM)

Like your hands that draw or build based on your brain’s idea

// React logic
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!');

// ReactDOM renders it to the page
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));



✅ 7. react.development.js vs react.production.js
Mode	development.js	production.js
🐞 Debugging	Shows errors, warnings, logs	Hides warnings
⚡ Performance	Slower	Faster (optimized)
🧠 Use case	For developers only	For live/real users

📌 You use development.js when building the app, and production.js when deploying it.




✅ 8. What is async and defer in script tags?

Imagine you’re reading a book 📖 and someone wants to talk to you 🗣️.

🌀 async

They interrupt you immediately when they’re ready (even if you’re mid-sentence).

Script runs as soon as it loads — may interrupt HTML parsing.

<script src="file.js" async></script>

⏳ defer

They wait till you finish reading, then talk.

Script runs after HTML is fully loaded (safer for DOM manipulation).

<script src="file.js" defer></script>



In Technical language we answer them like:



● What is Emmet?

Emmet is a plugin/tool for code editors (like VS Code, Sublime, etc.) that helps write HTML and CSS faster using abbreviations.

Example: Typing ul>li*3 and hitting Tab expands to:

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>




● Difference between a Library and Framework?
Feature	Library	Framework
Control	You call the library	Framework calls your code
Flexibility	More flexible	More opinionated (fixed structure)
Usage	Used for specific tasks	Provides a full structure
Example	jQuery, Lodash	Angular, Django

🟡 React is a Library, Angular is a Framework.




● What is CDN? Why do we use it?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.

It’s a network of servers distributed globally to deliver static content (like JS, CSS, images) faster.

Why use it?

Reduces load on your own server

Increases speed and performance

Improves availability and redundancy

Example:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>




● Why is React known as React?

React is called "React" because:

It enables reactive and dynamic user interfaces.

It automatically reacts to data changes and updates the DOM efficiently using its virtual DOM.



● What is crossorigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute is used when loading scripts from a different domain (CORS-related).

It controls how the browser handles cross-origin requests.

Common values:

anonymous – No credentials (cookies, HTTP auth) sent.

use-credentials – Sends credentials.

Example:

<script src="..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


Needed when:

Using CDNs

Ensuring proper error handling for crossorigin scripts




● What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
	React	ReactDOM
Role	Core library (logic, components)	Deals with rendering to the DOM
Example Use	React.createElement, Hooks	ReactDOM.render, createRoot
Package	react	react-dom

You use React to build components, and ReactDOM to render them into the page.




● Difference between react.development.js and react.production.js via CDN?
File	react.development.js	react.production.js
Use Case	Development	Production
Size	Larger (with warnings, checks)	Smaller (optimized)
Features	Helpful error messages	Stripped-down, faster

🟡 In production, always use production.js to improve performance.




● What is async and defer in <script> tag?

These attributes control how JavaScript is loaded.

Attribute	When Script Runs	Blocks HTML Parsing?
async	As soon as it's downloaded	Yes
defer	After HTML parsing is complete (in order)	No

Example:

<script src="script.js" async></script>
<script src="script.js" defer></script>


🟡 Use defer for scripts that depend on the full HTML being loaded.
🟡 Use async for independent,
