Answer of them are:
✅ 1. What is Emmet?

Think of Emmet like a text shortcut or autocomplete for HTML/CSS.

🔹 Just like typing "brb" on your phone becomes "be right back", Emmet lets you type ul>li*3 and expands it into:

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


🔹 It's a speed tool — saves time writing repetitive code.




✅ 2. Library vs Framework (Real-life analogy)
📚 Library

A library is like a cookbook. You pick and use the recipe (code) you need.

You’re in control. You decide when to use it.

Example: React, jQuery

🏗️ Framework

A framework is like a meal kit (e.g., HelloFresh) — it gives you ingredients, steps, and structure.

Framework is in control. You follow its rules.

Example: Angular, Django

🔁 In short:

Library = You call it.
Framework = It calls you.




✅ 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
📦 CDN = Content Delivery Network

Imagine your website is a pizza shop 🍕, and you want to deliver pizzas globally.

Without CDN: Only 1 shop → slow delivery 🌍

With CDN: Many branches worldwide → faster delivery 🚀

🔹 CDN hosts your static files (JS, CSS, images) closer to the user for fast loading.

Example:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18/umd/react.production.js"></script>




✅ 4. Why is React called React?

Because React helps the UI react to changes.

📱 Imagine you're using a messaging app. As soon as a new message comes, the chat updates automatically — this is reactive behavior.

🔹 React uses a Virtual DOM to detect changes and update only what's needed, making UI super fast.




✅ 5. What is crossorigin in <script>?

This attribute deals with security and resource sharing when loading scripts from another website (like a CDN).

💡 Think of it like ordering a part from another store. Do you want to send your ID or just get the part anonymously?

anonymous → Don’t send cookies or login info

use-credentials → Send cookies/login info

Example:

<script src="script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>




✅ 6. Difference between React and ReactDOM
🧠 React

Deals with building components and logic

Like your brain creating ideas

👀 ReactDOM

Renders those components into the actual page (DOM)

Like your hands that draw or build based on your brain’s idea

// React logic
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!');

// ReactDOM renders it to the page
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));



✅ 7. react.development.js vs react.production.js
Mode	development.js          	         production.js
🐞 Debugging	Shows errors, warnings,    logs	Hides warnings
⚡ Performance	Slower	                   Faster (optimized)
🧠 Use case	For developers only    	      For live/real users

📌 You use development.js when building the app, and production.js when deploying it.




✅ 8. What is async and defer in script tags?

Imagine you’re reading a book 📖 and someone wants to talk to you 🗣️.

🌀 async

They interrupt you immediately when they’re ready (even if you’re mid-sentence).

Script runs as soon as it loads — may interrupt HTML parsing.

<script src="file.js" async></script>

⏳ defer

They wait till you finish reading, then talk.

Script runs after HTML is fully loaded (safer for DOM manipulation).

<script src="file.js" defer></script>
